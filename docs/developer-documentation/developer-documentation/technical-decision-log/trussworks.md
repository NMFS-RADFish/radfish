# Trussworks Component Library

The [Trussworks component library](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds) is a set of standard components from React libraries and the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

## Why we chose this 
Trussworks component library adheres to USWDS standards. This ensures RADFish applications meet federal standards for accessibility and design. It also aligns with NOAAâ€™s branding guidelines and 508 compliance requirements.

## Trade-offs 
Using a specific component library might restrict design flexibility. However, using a single component library provides consistency. Trussworks also meets compliance standards, which is invaluable for government projects.

## Alternatives
[Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) and [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) offer extensive component libraries with customizable themes. These provides broader design options. However, Trussworks' specific focus on USWDS compliance and its integration with React makes it a better fit for RADFish.
