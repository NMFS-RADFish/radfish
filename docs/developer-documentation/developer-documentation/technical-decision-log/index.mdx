# RADFish Technical Decision Log

This section provides justification for the technologies and frameworks we chose for RADFish. Most pages include "Why we chose this", "Trade-offs", and "Alternatives" sections. These demonstrate pros, cons, and other options that were considered, respectively.

For more information about this section, read the [statement of purpose](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/developer-documentation/technical-decision-log/purpose).
