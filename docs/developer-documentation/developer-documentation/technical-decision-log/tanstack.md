# TanStack for State Management
[TanStack](https://tanstack.com/) provides utilities for state management, tables, and querying.

## Why we chose this 
TanStack helps manage server state and table state in RADFish applications. NOAA applications have complex data structures and multi-entry forms. TanStack creates an improved user experience with less boilerplate code.

## Trade-offs
Using Tanstack requires familiarity with its API and concepts, which may present a learning curve. However, it handles NOAAâ€™s data-centric applications and provides an enhanced user experience.
