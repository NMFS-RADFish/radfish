# JavaScript with JSDoc

[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) is an automatic API documentation generator. 

## Why we chose this 
JavaScript offers broad accessibility and ease of adoption for government contractors.  Combined with JS Docs, this helps standardize frontend development. JavaScript’s flexibility allows for broader adoption among government contractors. It also adapts to RADFish's diverse and evolving project requirements. JS Docs also doesn't impose the stricter typing system of TypeScript. 

## Trade-offs
TypeScript provides static typing, offering compile-time type checking, which reduces runtime errors. The absence of TypeScript’s compile-time type checking may increase reliance on runtime testing.  However, adopting TypeScript involves a steeper learning curve and potentially longer development times. RADFish leverages most developers' familiarity with JavaScript. JS Docs offers a balanced approach, providing some benefits of TypeScript without its overhead.

## Alternatives
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) can still be adopted by teams that wish to use it. Migrating from JS Docs to TypeScript is relatively straightforward. There are tools available to automate this process.
