# Purpose

This section provides justification for the technologies and frameworks we chose for RADFish. This provides transparency and clarity around the technical decisions we have made.

NOAA's frontend applications have unique requirements, such as:

- **Offline functionality.** Our users do not always have reliable internet access. Our applications must work offline.
- **Cross-platform performance.** Our applications must work on both mobile and desktop devices. They must work on a variety of operating systems and browsers. 
- **Regulation compliance.** Federal web applications must meet regulation standards, such as 508 Compliance.

Our choices must balance ease of use for our developers while meeting these challenges. We selected technologies and frameworks to create a cohesive, efficient, and compliant environment. The chosen stack optimizes developer productivity, application performance, and user experience.
