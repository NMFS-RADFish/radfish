# Examples

Examples are small projects designed to demonstrate RADFish ecosystem. Templates are meant to be a clean starting point for a new RADFish project.

The source code for each example is in the open source repo for RADFish [boilerplate](https://github.com/NMFS-RADFish/boilerplate/tree/main/examples). Each example can be cloned and run separately as you are working with each from the RADFish CLI. To learn how to run these scripts, refer to the [running examples section](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/developer-documentation/building-your-application/available-scripts/running-example).
