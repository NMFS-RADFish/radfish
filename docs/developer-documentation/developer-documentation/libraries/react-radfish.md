description: Modules to build a RADFish app in React

# `react-radfish`

The `react-radfish` NPM package contains the React component library for any RADFish project. It's designed for projects built with React or React-flavored frameworks (like Remix or Next.js). These modules expose components that can be used consistently across different React projects.

Note that this library is not meant to replace the `@trussworks` library. It's meant to work alongside it. Where possible, you should leverage the `@trussworks` library. However, if there's a component not in `@trussworks`, or there's shortcomings with the `@trussworks` implementation, you can rely on the components in the `@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish` package.

This library is open source and can be found here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish)
