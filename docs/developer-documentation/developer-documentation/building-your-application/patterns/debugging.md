# Debugging

Debugging is an important part developing Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). Debugging helps developers track real-time performance, identify and fix bugs, optimize code, and enhance user experience.

There are several common strategies for debugging a web application during development. These include but are not limited to:

- Adding breakpoints in code editor. [See vscode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_breakpoints).
- Adding logs to the development console. [See MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/learn-javascript-console-methods/).
- Using the network console. [See Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network).
- Using an HTTP client like Postman to test API calls. [See Postman documentation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/introduction/overview/).

You can use Postman to emulate a backend server response pattern. Postman works with the Mock Service Worker that is bundled with RadFish.
