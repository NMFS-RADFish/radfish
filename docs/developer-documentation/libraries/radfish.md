# `radfish`

The `radfish` NPM package contains the core JavaScript modules for any RADFish project. These modules are framework-agnostic. They should be fully functional whether you are building an application in React, Svelte, or even Vanilla JavaScript.

This library is open source and can be found here: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/radfish](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nmfs-radfish/radfish)
