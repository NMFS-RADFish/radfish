# Offline-First

Offline-first design prioritizes web app functionality even without internet connectivity. This means building the app so users can interact with it uninterrupted, even without a stable network. 

With offline-first, your application:

- **Stores data locally.** When the user interacts with the app, data is cached on the device.
- **Synchronizes data automatically.** When internet connectivity returns, the app synchronizes any pending changes with remote servers.
- **Provides a seamless experience.** Whether they're online or offline, users enjoy an uninterrupted experience.

## Service Workers: The Key to Offline-First

To achieve offline-first functionality, developers use Service Workers. Service Workers are scripts that run in the background of web applications. They allow network requests and data caching without requiring user interaction. Service Workers help build web applications that function even with internet connectivity issues.
