# Concepts

RADFish developers build applications that serve users in a variety of settings. Many of our users are commercial fishermen who harvest and process fish. Their work takes them to busy ports and the open sea, where internet connectivity can be unreliable or even non-existent.

Imagine being a commercial fisherman on a vessel in a remote area. You must sort through catch and record weights and species. You need your data to sync with offices back on land. You may have limited storage space on your devices. 

Modern users expect apps to be responsive and reliable, even with limited internet connectivity. This is especially true for professionals such as commercial fishers. These users often operate in remote areas with unstable network access. To meet these expectations, developers can implement on-device storage to enable offline functionality. This increases user satisfaction and also ensures that critical tasks can be performed without interruption.

Designing apps for these users present unique challenges. To meet these challenges, RADFish developers should be familiar with several concepts:

* [Offline-First](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/developer-documentation/concepts/offline-first) design prioritizes functionality even without internet connectivity. 
* [On-Device Storage](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/developer-documentation/concepts/on-device-storage) is storing data directly on a user's device, without relying on internet connectivity.
