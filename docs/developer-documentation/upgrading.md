# Upgrading

## How to keep your RADFish project up to date

Updating your RADFish version ensures stability, security, and the latest features. It also keeps your project free of warnings and errors. This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to update your RADFish packages. 

### 1. Upgrade Packages

    1. **Run command:** In the root of your project, run:
        ```bash
        npm update
        ```

        This will update both `@nmfs-radfish/radfish` and `@nmfs-radfish/react-radfish` along with their dependencies to the latest compatible versions.

    2. **Check for Changes:**  After running the update, you should verify that everything is working as expected. It's a good practice to run your test suite to catch any potential issues:
        ```bash
        npm test
        ```

### 2. Handling Warnings During Updates

    While updating your packages, you might encounter warnings. These warnings may not necessarily be RADFish-specific. These warnings often occur when certain packages in your project are outdated or incompatible. To get rid of these warnings:

    1. **Check for outdated packages:** Run the command below to list all outdated packages, including those not related to RADFish.
        ```bash
        npm outdated
        ```

    2. **Update dependencies:** You can selectively update non-react-radfish packages by running:
        ```bash
        npm update <package-name>
        ```

    3. **Resolve peer dependency warnings:** Some warnings may be related to peer dependencies. To resolve these, you might need to install or update the required dependencies manually.
        ```bash
        npm install <peer-dependency-name>
         ```

    4. **Remove deprecated packages:** If the warning is about deprecated packages, it’s a good idea to check if these packages are still necessary and remove them if they’re not.
        ```bash
        npm uninstall <deprecated-package>
        ```
