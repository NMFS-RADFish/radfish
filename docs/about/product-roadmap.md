# Roadmap

## 1\. What is a Project Roadmap?

The RADfish [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NMFS-RADFish/projects/2/views/3) is hosted on GitHub. It outlines the major features, improvements, and goals that the project intends to achieve over time. It visualizes the project's timeline and highlights features in future releases. The roadmap details upcoming, helps set expectations, prioritizes tasks, and track goal progress.

The RADFish project roadmap helps developers, users, and contributors align with NOAA Fisheries' electronic reporting modernization goals. It also fosters transparency and encourages collaboration by allowing contributors to see where they can make the most impact.

## 2\. RADFish Roadmap Goals

A well-maintained project roadmap for RADFish is important for several reasons:

1. **Transparency and Communication**: Both internal teams and the wider community can see which features and improvements are planned. This helps everyone stay informed about upcoming releases and align their efforts.
2. **Prioritization**: The roadmap helps the project focus on the most impactful tasks. It helps allocate resources to high-priority features that deliver the most value to NOAA Fisheries and its partners.
3. **Community Engagement**: Contributors can easily identify where they can get involved. They can help by building new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation. This invites more collaboration and helps grow the RADFish community.
4. **Long-Term Vision**: The roadmap provides a strategic view of how RADFish aims to evolve. This helps stakeholders understand the overall goals and provides a framework for future planning.

The roadmap is an evolving document. It's constantly updated as new contributions come in and priorities shift. By contributing, you help make RADFish a useful framework that meets NOAA Fisheries' evolving needs for web development.
