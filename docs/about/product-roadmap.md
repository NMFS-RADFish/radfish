# Roadmap

## 1\. What is a Project Roadmap?

The RADfish [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NMFS-RADFish/projects/2).

In the context of open-source projects like RADFish, a project roadmap is a high-level strategic guide that outlines the major features, improvements, and goals that the project intends to achieve over time. It serves as a visual timeline that highlights the project’s direction and provides insights into what the community can expect in future releases. The roadmap not only details upcoming work but also helps to set expectations, prioritize tasks, and track progress against defined goals.

For RADFish, the project roadmap is critical in helping developers, users, and contributors align their efforts with NOAA Fisheries' larger vision for electronic reporting modernization. It also fosters transparency and encourages collaboration by allowing contributors to see where they can make the most impact.

## 2\. RADFish Roadmap Goals

A well-maintained project roadmap for RADFish is important for several reasons:

1. **Transparency and Communication**: It allows both internal teams and the wider community to understand what features and improvements are planned. This helps everyone stay informed about upcoming releases and align their efforts accordingly.
2. **Prioritization**: The roadmap helps the project maintain focus on the most impactful tasks. It ensures that resources are allocated to high-priority features that deliver the most value to NOAA Fisheries and its partners.
3. **Community Engagement**: Contributors can easily identify where they can get involved, whether by building new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation. This invites more collaboration and helps grow the RADFish community.
4. **Long-Term Vision**: The roadmap provides a strategic view of how RADFish aims to evolve, helping stakeholders understand the overall goals and providing a framework for future planning.

The roadmap is an evolving document, constantly updated as new contributions come in and priorities shift. By contributing, you help ensure that RADFish remains a useful framework that meets NOAA Fisheries' evolving needs for web development.
