# Accessibility and Open Source Policy

This section covers our accessibility and open source policies. It also covers certain other policies relevant to the RADFish project, this documentation, and our repos. Review this page to learn how we ensure compliance and user accessibility throughout the project.

## 1\. Accessibility Policy

At RADFish, we're committed to ensuring that all users can fully engage with our project. We adhere to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Key accessibility features include:

- **Alternative text for images.** Make sure all images have descriptive text.
- **Strong color contrast**: Maintain high contrast between foreground and background colors for readability.
- **Text resizing.** Allow users to adjust text sizes based on personal preferences.
- **Proper use of headings.** Structure pages to ensure clear navigation for screen readers.
- **Descriptive links.** Avoid ambiguous text like "Click here" or "More..." and instead using meaningful link descriptions.
- **Accessible tables.** Make sure tables have proper headings for structured data.

We aim for WCAG AA compliance and seek to meet AAA compliance where feasible. This helps make our framework accessible to all users. If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please contact us at radfish-accessibility@noaa.gov with details about the issue. Including the URL and a description of any challenges you experienced. We'll make every effort to provide the information you need and improve our accessibility efforts.

## 2\. Open Source Policy

As an open-source project, RADFish is committed to transparency and collaboration. All software code developed by NOAA Fisheries for RADFish, or by contractors developing software on behalf of NOAA Fisheries, is released under an open-source [Apache License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), Version 2.0. All source code, documentation, and governance policies will be accessible to NOAA Fisheries and our partners via GitHub. The use of the open-source license and GitHub enables transparent and collaborative development. Updates or improvements made to the core framework can be shared across NOAA regions. This cross-regional collaboration ensures ongoing alignment and innovation.

Contributors to the RADFish project should follow our Open Source Policy:

- This project is licensed under the [Apache License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), Version 2.0. Please make sure that any contributions comply with this license. If you are submitting code or other contributions, you are agreeing to license your contributions under this same license.
- For external libraries or code used in the project, we provide attribution as necessary. If you believe an attribution is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/NMFS-RADFish/radfish/issues).
- We leverage open-source tools and libraries where appropriate to meet NOAA Fisheries' needs for efficient and scalable web applications.
- Code developed by NOAA Fisheries staff is by default in the public domain. However, modifications of third-party open-source libraries are considered “joint works” and are released under the terms of the original license.

All RADFish source code is hosted on GitHub and is accessible to the public for reuse, modification, and improvement, as long as those contributions comply with our license and open-source governance policies.

## 3\. Linking Policy
