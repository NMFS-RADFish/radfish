# Accessibility and Open Source Policy

This section covers our policies regarding accessibility and open source and other information relevant to the RADFish project, this documentation, and our repos. Please review the information below to understand how we ensure compliance and user accessibility across all aspects of the project.

## 1\. Accessibility Policy

At RADFish, we are committed to ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can fully engage with our project. We adhere to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as well as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Key accessibility features include:

- **Alternative text for images**: Ensuring that all images are accompanied by descriptive text.
- **Strong color contrast**: Maintaining a high level of contrast between foreground and background colors for readability.
- **Text resizing**: Allowing users to adjust text sizes based on personal preferences.
- **Proper use of headings**: Structured to ensure clear navigation for screen readers.
- **Descriptive links**: Avoiding ambiguous text like "Click here" or "More..." and instead using meaningful link descriptions.
- **Accessible tables**: Ensuring tables are used properly with headings for structured data.

We aim for WCAG AA compliance and seek to meet AAA compliance where feasible to ensure our framework is accessible to all users. If you encounter any accessibility barriers, please contact us at radfish-accessibility@noaa.gov with details about the issue, including the URL and any challenges you experienced. We will make every effort to provide the information you need and improve our accessibility efforts.

## 2\. Open Source Policy

As an open-source project, RADFish is committed to transparency and collaboration. All software code developed by NOAA Fisheries for RADFish, or by contractors developing software on behalf of NOAA Fisheries, is released under an open-source [Apache License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), Version 2.0. All source code, documentation, and governance policies will be accessible to NOAA Fisheries and our partners via GitHub, allowing for transparent and collaborative development. Updates or improvements made to the core framework can be shared across regions, ensuring ongoing alignment and innovation. Other considerations include:

- This project is licensed under the [Apache License](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), Version 2.0. Please make sure that any contributions comply with this license. If you are submitting code or other contributions, you are agreeing to license your contributions under this same license.
- For external libraries or code used in the project, we provide attribution as necessary. If you believe an attribution is missing, please [open and issue](https://github.com/NMFS-RADFish/radfish/issues).
- We leverage open-source tools and libraries where appropriate to meet NOAA Fisheries' needs for efficient and scalable web applications.
- Code developed by NOAA Fisheries staff is by default in the public domain. However, modifications of third-party open-source libraries are considered “joint works” and are released under the terms of the original license.

All RADFish source code is hosted on GitHub and is accessible to the public for reuse, modification, and improvement, as long as those contributions comply with our license and open-source governance policies.

## 3\. Linking Policy

RADFish documentation and repositories may link to other websites and resources, following the policies below:

- We may link to publicly available government websites that are hosted on .gov, .mil, and .fed.us domains, or other state and local government sites, such as california.gov.

When you follow an external link, you are subject to the privacy and security policies of the destination website.

## 4\. Disclaimer of Endorsement

Any personal information shared with us will be used solely to respond to your request or feedback. We do not disclose, sell, or transfer any personal information unless required by law.
