# Community

We're building an active open-source community of NOAA Fisheries and our partners. This community will support the React Applications Development Framework for Fisheries (RADFish). Our contributors will help modernize electronic reporting and collaborate on web development efforts.

## 1\. Join the RADFish Community

The RADFish community is vital to the framework’s success. We'll work together to create standardized, modular, and reusable web components for fisheries electronic reporting. We invite contributors from across NOAA Fisheries and our partners to join the conversation, share their expertise, and collaborate on solving common challenges.

Explore RADFish on GitHub for access to the codebase, documentation, and issue tracking. Refer to our [Contribution Guidelines](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/about/contribute) to actively participate in the project

Having trouble? Email [joshua.lee@noaa.gov](mailto:joshua.lee@noaa.gov) with Join the “RADFish Community” in the subject line.

## 2\. Community Conduct

By joining the RADFish community, you agree to follow the Community Guidelines. Respect your peers, use clear language, be patient, and provide constructive feedback. This ensures we maintain a safe, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone. 

The Project Governance team will oversee community contributions, ensuring that all feedback, code submissions, and discussions align with the mission and technical goals of RADFish. We encourage open dialogue, but we also emphasize the importance of adhering to community standards to foster a collaborative and supportive space for all participants.
