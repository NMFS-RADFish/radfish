# About

## About the React Applications Development Framework For Fisheries (RADFish)

RADFish is an initiative developed by NOAA Fisheries to modernize and streamline electronic reporting and other applications development efforts across multiple regions.

## 1\. Why It Matters

Traditionally, fisheries data collection has relied on paper-based methods that are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and delays. In response to growing demands for more reliable and efficient data collection, NOAA Fisheries has prioritized the transition to electronic reporting. This modern approach enhances the quality of data while also streamlining processes across various regions and programs. However, until now, many regions have developed their own electronic reporting systems independently, leading to duplication of efforts, inconsistent practices, and siloed technology stacks, among other challenges. The need for a unified, cross-regional framework is essential to eliminate these inefficiencies and foster better coordination.

## 2\. Our Vision

The core objective of RADFish is to build an active community that supports and provides a standardized, modular, and reusable framework for web development across different regions, with a focus on enabling offline data collection through progressive web application (PWA) technologies. This framework is modularized to meet varying program-specific needs while maintaining consistency in technology, security, and accessibility standards. It is based on [React](https://react.dev/), a leading open-source JavaScript library known for its scalability and flexibility, and includes the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) as implemented by the [react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds) open source project.

## 3\. Key Benefits

- **Modular and Reusable**: The framework provides pre-built, ready-made components, boilerplate scaffolding, CLI tooling, and examples that can be easily adapted for different web development projects, speeding up the development process and reducing redundant work.

- **Cross-Regional Standardization**: By utilizing a common framework, NOAA Fisheries will be able to standardize web development best practices across regions, ensuring consistency while allowing for flexible, program-specific customizations.

- **Powered by React:** RADFish is built on [React](https://react.dev/), enabling developers to leverage reusable components and follow modern web development best practices. This ensures flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in building feature-rich, dynamic web applications.

- **Progressive Web Application Ready:** RADFish supports PWA development, allowing apps to function offline and provide a seamless user experience even in low-connectivity environments. Ideal for at-sea data collection and other fieldwork scenarios.

- **Consistent and Accessible Styling:** RADFish incorporates styling based on the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) as implemented by the [react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds) open source project, ensuring a consistent, accessible, and user-friendly interface across all NOAA applications. This promotes compliance with federal design standards and enhances usability for all users.

- **Open-Source Governance**: All source code, documentation, and governance policies will be accessible to NOAA Fisheries and our partners via GitHub, allowing for transparent and collaborative development. Updates or improvements made to the core framework can be shared across regions, ensuring ongoing alignment and innovation.

## 4\. Project Scope

By adopting free and open source and agile development principles, the project will continuously evolve through use by the community and iterative sprints, with each phase delivering fully-tested, fully-documented software that meets security, accessibility, and operational standards. The ultimate goal is to provide NOAA Fisheries with a unified, cost-effective, and scalable solution for fisheries electronic reporting, improving both the quality of data collected and the efficiency of fisheries management across the board.

## 5\. Conclusion

RADFish represents a critical advancement in modernizing fisheries data collection. It addresses the current challenges of fragmented systems and inconsistent practices, while enabling the efficient development of new, secure, and accessible electronic reporting systems. NOAA Fisheries is committed to making this framework publicly available and open-source, ensuring its broad utility and long-term sustainability across fisheries programs nationwide.
