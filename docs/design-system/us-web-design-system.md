# U.S. Web Design System

The [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) is a set of design and development principles and guidelines. It helps deveolpers create standardized, accessible, consistent, and user-friendly websites and applications. 

In most cases, RADFish uses standard components from React libraries and the U.S. Design System, as implemented by the [react-uswds open source project](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds). RADFish also uses some custom components which are not part of these standardized libraries. These custom components are listed [here](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/design-system/custom-components).
