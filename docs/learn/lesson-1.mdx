# Lesson 1: Navigation

Welcome to the RADFish tutorial! In this first lesson, we'll implement navigation within the app by making the "Start New Trip" button functional.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NMFS-RADFish/learn-radfish.git
cd learn-radfish

## Implement "Start New Trip" Navigation

Currently, the "Start New Trip" button on the home page doesn't do anything. We need to make it navigate the user to the first step of the trip logging process, which will be at the `/start` route. We'll use the `useNavigate` hook from `react-router-dom` for this.

Open `src/pages/Home.jsx`. Locate the `Button` component for "Start New Trip". You will modify this button by adding an `onClick` handler.

**Here's the button before adding navigation:**
```jsx jsx title="src/pages/Home.jsx" showLineNumbers=293
<Button
  type="button"
  className="bg-primary hover:bg-primary-darker width-full"
>
  Start New Trip
</Button>
```

**Add this code to implement navigation:**
```jsx howLineNumbers
onClick={() => {
  navigate("/start");
}}
```

**Complete button with navigation:**
```jsx title="src/pages/Home.jsx" showLineNumbers=293
<Button
  type="button"
  className="bg-primary hover:bg-primary-darker width-full"
  //diff-add-start
  onClick={() => {
    navigate("/start");
  }}
  //diff-add-end
>
  Start New Trip
</Button>
```

**Explanation:**
*   We're adding an `onClick` event handler to the `Button`.
*   Inside the handler, we call the `navigate` function (which we get from the `useNavigate()` hook provided earlier in the component).
*   We pass the string `"/start"` to `navigate`, telling React Router to change the URL to `/start` when the button is clicked. This will cause the `App` component to render the `StartTrip` page component associated with that route.

**Test Navigation:**
*   Start the development server for testing with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
*   Open the application in your browser (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the dev server).
*   Click the "Start New Trip" button. You should now be navigated to a new page (which is currently blank or basic, as we haven't built the `StartTrip` form yet).

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you implemented the first navigation feature in the application. You linked the home page button to the start of the trip logging workflow using React Router. The application now has a functional starting point for logging a new trip.
