# Learn RADFish

Welcome to the RADFish tutorial! In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to build a complete **Fisheries Trip Logging Application** using RADFish, NOAA's React framework for offline-first data collection.

## The App We're Building

Throughout this tutorial, you'll build a fisheries data collection application that commercial fishermen can use to log their trips and catches. This Progressive Web App (PWA) works offline and syncs data when connectivity is restored.

### Key Features You'll Implement

- **üö¢ Trip Management**: Start and end fishing trips with date, time, and weather conditions
- **üêü Catch Logging**: Record detailed information about each fish caught (species, weight, length, coordinates, time)
- **üìù Dynamic Forms**: Build interactive forms with repeatable catch entry
- **üìä Data Review**: Display aggregated catch statistics organized by species using tables
- **üì± Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet connection using IndexedDB
- **üîÑ Server Sync**: Send data to backend APIs when online using JSON server
- **‚ö° Progressive Web App**: Offline-first and mobile-optimized

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to:

### RADFish Core Concepts
- **Offline Storage**: Use IndexedDB with RADFish schemas and collections
- **State Management**: Manage application state with RADFish hooks
- **Data Relationships**: Link related data across collections (trips and catches)

### React & USWDS Integration
- **Component Architecture**: Build accessible forms using Trussworks React USWDS components
- **Navigation**: Implement multi-step workflows with React Router
- **Form Validation**: Implement client-side validation with user-friendly error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Create mobile-first layouts following federal design standards

### Progressive Web App Features
- **Network Detection**: Provide dynamic UI feedback based on connectivity using `useOfflineStatus`
- **Data Synchronization**: Handle online/offline data persistence and sync patterns

## Learning Path

This tutorial is divided into 7 progressive lessons:

1. **Page Structure & Navigation** - Set up USWDS grid layouts and routing
2. **Start Trip Form Inputs** - Build date pickers, time pickers, and select components
3. **Form Submission** - Save data to offline storage with RADFish
4. **Dynamic Inputs** - Create repeatable catch logging forms with collection relationships
5. **Form Validation** - Implement validation rules and error handling across all forms
6. **Review & Tables** - Display aggregated data with computed fields and offline detection
7. **Server Submission** - Handle online/offline data synchronization with JSON server

Each lesson builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new RADFish concepts and React patterns.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- **React Knowledge**: Basic understanding of React components, hooks, and state management
- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: ES6+ syntax, async/await, and modern JavaScript concepts
- **Development Environment**: Node.js 18+ installed on your machine
- **Terminal Familiarity**: Comfortable running npm commands and navigating file systems

No prior experience with RADFish, PWAs, or offline-first development is required - we'll teach you everything you need to know!

## Ready to Start?

This tutorial takes a hands-on approach. You'll be writing code from the very first lesson, building features incrementally while learning RADFish concepts along the way.

The completed application demonstrates patterns designed for NOAA fisheries applications, making this tutorial valuable whether you're building data collection apps for scientific research, regulatory compliance, or commercial fishing operations.
