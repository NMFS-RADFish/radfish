              RADFish, developed by NOAA Fisheries and its partners, is a
              React.js framework designed to streamline the creation and
              improvement of web applications for NOAA and its collaborators.
              This open-source framework, hosted on GitHub, offers standardized
              components such as a progressive web application (PWA) API for
              offline data collection, accessibility standards, and styling
              based on the U.S. Web Design System. By enabling developers to
              quickly build mobile-first, offline-capable web applications,
              RADFish reduces development time, ensures organizational
              consistency, and supports the modernization of our data
              systemsâ€”leading to better coordination and more efficient data
              collection.
